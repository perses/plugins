# Release process

To release a new version of one or multiple plugins, you should:
1. Update the version number in its(their) respective `package.json` file(s).
2. Run `npm install` at the root of the repo to propagate this update to the root `package-lock.json`.
3. Commit these changes ("Prepare \<plugin\> release vX.Y.Z")
4. Run [release.go](./scripts/release/release.go) (see instructions there).

Further actions will then be triggered on GitHub side (see release stage in the [CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)).

No automatic changelog generation, you can always edit the description of the generated release(s) if you want.
