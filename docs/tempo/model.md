# Tempo plugin models

This documentation provides the definition of the different plugins related to Tempo.

## Datasource

```yaml
kind: "TempoDatasource"
spec:
  # It is the url of the datasource.
  # Leave it empty if you don't want to access the datasource directly from the UI.
  # You should define a proxy if you want to access the datasource through the Perses' server.
  directUrl: <url> # Optional

  # It is the http configuration that will be used by the Perses' server to redirect to the datasource any query sent by the UI.
  proxy: <HTTP Proxy specification> # Optional
```

### HTTP Proxy specification

  # `datasource` is a datasource selector. If not provided, the default TempoDatasource is used.
