# Tempo

The Tempo plugins provide comprehensive support for Grafana Tempo distributed tracing in Perses dashboards.

## Datasource (`TempoDatasource`)

The Tempo datasource enables connection between Perses and your Tempo instance for distributed tracing data.

It supports the [proxy](https://perses.dev/perses/docs/concepts/proxy/) feature of Perses that allows to restrict the access to your data source.
