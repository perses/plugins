# Datasource Variable

TODO

This plugin allows the possibility to use a datasource as a variable in your dashboard, specially in the queries of your panels.

This is particularly useful when you have multiple datasources of the same type, such as multiple Prometheus instances, and you would like to switch between them without having to modify each panel query.
